      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <!-- <p>Hi! My name is Marie Taoko, I was born in Granville, a small town on the coast of Normandy (France), in 1999. I spent most of my childhood in Rouen (Normandy), with my family. </br>
        All my life, I have been interested in art, an interest that deepened greatly when I was 14 years old and started to be interested in fashion. Subsequently, I began to draw frequently, especially clothes and characters from series and movies. </p>
      <p>In 2019, I moved to Montreal to study art at a university level. </br>
        Nowadays, I am following a bachelor in design at Concordia University – Montreal. Being interested in Graphic Design and Web Design, I am progressively finding myself, and what I want my practice to be all about. </p> -->
        <p>Hello! I am Marie Taoko. I am originally from France, and I moved to Montreal for my studies. <br>
          Now, I am doing a bachelor’s in design at Concordia University, and I work as a graphic designer in various projects.</p>
          <p>My purpose as a graphic designer is to welcome and appreciate everyone in my work. I aim to work with honesty, sharing, diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility for all people to feel acknowledged, understood, considered, appreciated, and be able to identify to my designs. <br>
          My surroundings, passions, acquired knowledge, and lived experiences are at the base of my practice. They guided me towards the values that reflect who I am as a person and as a designer. 
          </p>
      <!-- <p>Part of my inspiration comes from the passion I have in travelling, performance arts, the human body and its physilogy.
        Hence a practice of my art tainted with interculturality, sharing, and modernity. </p> -->
